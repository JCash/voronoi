# Some examples

Here you can find some example programs using the voronoi generator to achieve

_From the suggestion of [@abetusk](https://github.com/abetusk)_

This example outputs 10 random 2D coordinates, and all the generated edges, to standard output.
Note that the edges have duplicates, but you can easily filter them out.
